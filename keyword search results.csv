314897,501400000.0,Roofing,Re:  Flat roof approximately 37X25.  We propose the following 10 year Carlisle roofing system:Strip off existing roof system.  Clean all loose debris from roof.  Install 1- inch poly-urethane insulation board with an r-factor of approximately 5.6 (not the 1/2_inch recovery board that has no R-factor rating and which we in the field have found to be substandard) over roof area and screw down using disks and screws.  Lay out .060 rubber roof membrane  cutting out all protrusions as we go  such as: soil pipes  penthouses  skylights  etc.  Fold back rubber  apply bonding adhesive to both insulation and to rubber membrane.  Wait until tacky  about 15 minutes.  Then fold rubber over insulation to form a tight seal.  -	Install pre-molded vent pipe boots to vent pipes where possible.  -	Rubber flash all chimneys  skylights  and protrusions on roof with rubber flashing.  -	Install a pressure treated wood edge nailer.  Install .032 heavy gauge metal to outside edges of roof and seal all nails with rubber edge flashing.  -	Install R.U.S.S. strip where needed at any transitions to prevent bridging.-	Where drains exist  install copper sleeve in drain and seal as needed.  -	Clean all debris from job site.  The above work will carry a ten year contractorÕs warranty on labor and materials under normal wear and tear. Additional specifications:-	Under coping stone thereÕs no securement of metal.  We will secure approximately every foot.-	Install pourable sealer around a.c  large one  to incorporate 3 pieces.-	Re: All electrical and a.c. conduit  at least 14 of them. We will install 14-15 new securement plates/fasteners. (We are not responsible if the existing fasteners break due to their age.)-	Jack up stairs on stairwell.  Remove concrete blocks. Install new cement blocks.  Lower stairs back down.Approximately 13 _ 15 blocks holding pipes together on roof.  We will take them apart and put them back together properly with new hardware and pressure treated wood blocks,8/11/15 13:17,2/11/16 0:00,101382.0

328585,400968000.0,Roofing,Top roof/main part above option:We propose the following 10 year Carlisle roofing system:Clean all loose debris from roof.  Remove all existing metal.  Install pressure treated lumber on bottom edge with 6-inch width 7/8-inch thick to all four sides as well as outside front on main on opposite side of parapet wall. Install 1- inch poly-urethane insulation board with an r-factor of approximately 5.6 (not the 1/2_inch recovery board that has no R-factor rating and which we in the field have found to be substandard) over roof area and screw down using disks and screws.  Lay out .060 rubber roof membrane  cutting out all protrusions as we go  such as: soil pipes  penthouses  skylights  etc.  Fold back rubber  apply bonding adhesive to both insulation and to rubber membrane.  Wait until tacky  about 15 minutes.  Then fold rubber over insulation to form a tight seal.  -	Install pre-molded vent pipe boots to vent pipes where possible.  -	Rubber flash all chimneys  skylights  and protrusions on roof with rubber flashing.  -	Install a pressure treated wood edge nailer.  Install .032 heavy gauge metal to outside edges of roof and seal all nails with rubber edge flashing. -	Install R.U.S.S. strip where needed at any transitions to prevent bridging.-	Re: Elevator shaft. Install roof system and flash around shaft.-	Install T-board over flashings on four sides.-	Flash all chimneys.-	Two old  possibly galvanized  pipe that are not cast iron need to be rubber flashed all the way up. (Note: pipe are not included in warranty due to their condition)-	Terminate rubber into gutter on bottom edges so flashing doesnÕt separate at seams prematurely on 80 foot lengths. Note: Termination bar  in most cases increases life span to 30 years.-	Clean all debris from job site.  ,4/14/16 13:35,10/14/16 0:00,120810.0

I can turn around an application like that in one day and then you can go get your permit. You will then have to submit plans and another application when you intend to rebuild it  unless you want to submit that information now.Katie K.
