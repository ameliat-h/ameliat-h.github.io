	<p>I'm a first-year Masters of City Planning student at MIT,
  interested in cognitive urbanism. Here are some true facts about me:
	I grew up in Los Angeles, I like to make comics, and Joshua
Tree is one of my favorite places on Earth.</p>
<p>Here is my favorite joke:</p>

  <p>A horse walks into a bar.</p>
  <p>The bartender asks, "Hey buddy, why the long face?"<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
  <p>The horse replies, "My wife just left me."</p>
